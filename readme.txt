**NOTE: You need to register an account on the Sagenda site and then you will get an authentication code which you will use to validate your Sagenda plugin.**

**Shortcode**
You can use Sagenda as shortcode in any page or plugin :
`[sagenda-calendar-wp]`

You can force the Calendar to display only one bookable item. Please then use the shortcode like this :
`[sagenda-calendar-wp fixedbookableitem="x"]`
where x is the "id" of your bookable item. To know the id of your bookable item, you can just go to your bookable item list :  [https://sagenda.net/BookableItems/List](https://sagenda.net/BookableItems/List) and select "edit". You can then copy the ID with the copy button. 
You can also use this feature with URL query parameter such as adding ?fixedbookableitem="x" to your URL. Please don't use both shortcode and query parameter "fixedbookableitem" in the same time. 

You can choose the default view 
`[sagenda-calendar-wp defaultView="x"]`
where x is the "month", "week", "workWeek", "day", "agenda".

You can also use timeline : "timelineDay", "timelineMonth", "timelineWeek", "timelineWorkWeek".

You can unactivate view(s) :
Those views are enabled by default, but you can remove them :
`[sagenda-calendar-wp removeMonthViewButton="true" removeWeekViewButton="true" removeWorkWeekViewButton="true" removeDayViewButton="true" removeAgendaViewButton="true"]`
This will simply remove the corresponding button to switch from a view to another one. Please understand you can't remove all views (at least one should be allowed to load). If you remove the "month" view, you have to define a new default : defaultView="x".


You can activate view(s) :
Those views are disabled by default, if you want you can add them. Anyway very few people need a timeline view, think twice before adding it.
`[sagenda-calendar-wp removeTimelineDayViewButton="false" removeTimelineMonthViewButton="false" removeTimelineWeekViewButton="false" removeTimelineWorkWeekViewButton="false"]`
